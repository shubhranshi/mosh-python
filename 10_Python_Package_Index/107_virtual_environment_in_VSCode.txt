If we try to run the program using code error(normal "run" in our editor) we will get the same error

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'

Because VSCode(editor) is running this program using the Python interpreter that is installed globally.
And that Python interpreter can not find the module.
To fix this problem we need to tell code runner to use the Python interpreter that is in our virtual environment.

To get the virtual environment folder run the command:
> pipenv --venv

In this case it will be:
C:\Users\user\.virtualenvs\HelloWorld-DELSOGnB

We need to go the user setting of the file extension (Preferences/Setting/open the json), and add this to the json file:
    "code-runner.executorMap": {
        "python": "C:\\Users\\user\\.virtualenvs\\HelloWorld-DELSOGnB\\Scripts\\python",
    }
