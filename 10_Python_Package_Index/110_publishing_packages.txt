How to publish our own packages to pypi.org
https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/

Here are some steps

1. Create a new account on pypi.org.

2. We need to install some tools (3 tools: setuptools, wheel, twine) globally:

> pip install setuptools wheel twine

3. Create new directory (that will have all our package files)

> mkdir mypdf
> cd mypdf

This should have below folders. The name of the package can be same as
the high level directory "mypdf" that has all the code

- mypdf
    - data  (sample data)
    - mypdf (source code goes here)
        - __init__.py   (to indicates python that this is a package)
        - pdf2text.py   (add modules)
    - test (unit testing)


4. We need to add additional 3 files in order to publish this package.
setup.py (important) - add at the root level
README.md - markdown file, content in this file will be displayed on the homepage of our package on Pypi
LICENSE - (we can get a basic license template from http://choosealicense.com and paste it here)

- mypdf
    - data
    - mypdf
        - __init__.py
        - pdf2text.py
        - pdf2image.py
    - test
    - setup.py
    - README.md
    - LICENSE


Inside "setup.py":

    import setuptools
    from pathlib import Path

    setuptools.setup(
        name="mypdf",      # name of our package, should not conflict with the existing packages on pypi
        version=1.0,
        long_description=Path("README.md").read_text(),
        packages=setuptools.find_packages(exclude=["test", "data"])   # indicates what packages are going to be distributed/published
    )
    # "find_packages()" this method looks at our project and automatically discovers defined packages.
    # However we can tell it to exclude 2 directories (test, data) as they do not include source code by
    # giving them as an argument in an array to this function


Inside "README.md":

    This is the homepage of our project.


5. Now to generate distribution package, in the terminal execute below command (inside root directory):
> python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

We generate 2 distribution packages with this - source distribution, and build distribution.
2 folders get added to the root level - build, and dist.

6. Final step is to upload it on Pypi.org.
Execute below command on terminal:
> twine upload dist/*
Enter your username: ---
Enter your password: ***

Now the package is uploaded on Pypi.
