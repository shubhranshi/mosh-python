# In this complete section, we will look at some popular packages in the python community.

API : Application Programming Interface

A lot of websites make their data available to others via APIs.
APIs are end point that are public accessible on the internet.
So they have url just like websites.

For example: Yelp has an API for searching for businesses : /businesses/search

This api has an endpoint https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search

So we can send a http request to this endpoint to get a list of businesses that match some criteria.

HTTP request methods:
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Yelp Fusion : for finding businesses, working with events, categories, etc.

To get started, first we need to create a new app.
Upon creating a new app, a client id and API key will be generated.

Client ID uniquely identifies our application. (Just like a username for an application).

API key will be needed when we want to connect to any endpoints. (it is like a password, for security)
