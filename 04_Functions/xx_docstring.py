# The first string after the function is called the Document string or Docstring in short.
# This is used to describe the functionality of the function. The use of docstring in functions
# is optional, but it is considered a good practice.

# The below syntax can be used to print out the docstring of a function:
# print(function_name.__doc__)

# Example: Adding Docstring to the function

# A simple Python function to check
# whether x is even or odd


def evenOdd(x):
    """Function to check if the number is even or odd"""

    if (x % 2 == 0):
        print("even")
    else:
        print("odd")


# Driver code to call the function
print(evenOdd.__doc__)
