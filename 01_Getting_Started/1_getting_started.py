# Python 3 tutorial

# Linting:
# A linter is tool that checks our code for potential errors.
# If linting is enabled, we can see red underline or warnings whenever we write incorrect
# code syntax or incomplete code.
# As we are writing code, we can see potential problems in our code. Dont have to wait to run the code.
# Pylint (is a linter) can tell us in case of invalid syntax or invalid grammer.
# other examples: flake8, mypy, PEP8, pylint --> linters in python

# The python we use is the cpython implementation of python language.

# An expression is a piece of code that produces value.
