### Finding an Interpreter:
Before we start Python programming, we need to have an interpreter to interpret and run our programs.
There are certain online interpreters like https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/ that can be used to run
Python programs without installing an interpreter.

### Reason for increasing popularity
1. Emphasis on code readability, shorter codes, ease of writing
2. Programmers can express logical concepts in fewer lines of code in comparison to languages
    such as C++ or Java.
3. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, like object-oriented, imperative and functional
    programming or procedural.
4. There exists inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequently used concepts.
5. Philosophy is “Simplicity is the best”.

### LANGUAGE FEATURES
1. Interpreted
    a. There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++.
    b. Directly run the program from the source code.
    c. Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes which is then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.
    d. No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.
2. Platform Independent
    a. Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
    b. Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.
3. Free and Open Source; Redistributable
4. High-level Language
    In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program.
5. Simple
    a. Closer to English language;Easy to Learn
    b. More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax
6. Embeddable
    Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.
7. Robust:
    a. Exceptional handling features
    b. Memory management techniques in built
8. Rich Library Support
    a. The Python Standard Library is very vast.
    b. Known as the “batteries included” philosophy of Python ;It can help do various things involving regular expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, email, XML, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI and many more.
    c. Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries such as the Python Imaging Library which is an amazingly simple image manipulation library.


### Python vs JAVA

a) Python - Dynamically Typed

No need to declare anything. An assignment statement binds a name to an object, and the object can be of any type.
No type casting is  required when using container objects

Concise Express much in limited words

Compact

Uses Indentation for structuring code

b) JAVA - Statically Typed

All variable names (along with their types) must be explicitly declared. Attempting to assign an object of the wrong type to a variable name triggers a type exception.
Type casting is required when using container objects.

Verbose Contains more words

Less Compact

Uses braces for structuring code
