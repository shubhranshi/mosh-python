08 Admin

We are going to activate the administration panel.
That way we can allow the staff of our imaginary video rental store to populate the list of movies.
All Django applications come with a powerful application interface.

> python manage.py runserver
If we navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ we can see the authentication panel,
to log in to the administration panel.
This is coming from the "auth" app.

The next step is to create a super user. That it is going to be the first user.
For that we use the command:
> python manage.py createsuperuser

And follow the indicate steps in the terminal.
give username and password.
(admin/djangoadmin)

Back to admin page, login with this credential.
Now we can see the admin panel. We can manage the lists of users, groups, we can put users in
different groups like moderator, admin, guests, etc. Currently, we can only manage users and groups.

We can also manage our custom models using the administrative interface.
To add the models to the administration interface -
Go to the "admin.py" in the "movies" app.
And there we need to import the classes.

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Genre, Movie        # We use the "." to indicate the current folder.

admin.site.register(Genre)
admin.site.register(Movie)

With those lines of code we register those classes in the administration panel.
So now if we refresh the admin page, we can see the other two models(Genre and Movie) also.
Now we can add objects in them.
