15 Url Parameters


In case we want to add a new page that show the movies details.
Like, we can click the name of the movie and the details page open up.

First we create a new path in our "urlpatterns" variable in the "url.py" from the "movies" app.

Our url is going to take a parameter, in this case the movie "id"
For example:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/1

We use angle brackets to define a parameter '<>'
(To refresh our prev lecture: The main urls module in our project hands off any url's that starts
with 'movies/' to this url's module in the movies app)

In this case we prefix it with "int" to force an integer as the parameter.
Because our movies id are integers.

urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index, name="movies_index"),
    path("<int:movie_id>", views.detail, name="movies_details")
]


Then create the view function in the view.py in movies app

def detail(request, movie_id):
    return HttpResponse(movie_id)

Our function receives the "request" parameter and the "movie_id" parameter that we defined
in the "urlpatterns".
